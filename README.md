### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm 0K9090. 

I program in both Shell Script and Python.
Right now I am working on a project called ScratchLang, which is a tool to make Scratch a non-visual programming language.
I'm also working on sm64ex-omm.sh, which is the OMM Builder ported to Shell Script. It's mainly for people who want to contribute but don't know Python (I didn't know that language at the time).
